==============================================

In general, the 3.0x version and the 3.1x versions come
from the same source repository, so both versions
have basically the same features.
Since the newer black PCB has a slightly different 
circuit, there may be some features only available in
the V3.1x versions.

Note:
-----
V3.0x is ONLY for the "green PCB"
V3.1x is ONLY for the now sold "black PCB"


15.3.2007 V3.05 released by Wolferl
First public released version.
- Reworked RX stick reading (does no longer influence PID controllers)
- Camera servos working. Use RX channel 6 für elevation control.
- "Model lost" beeper works now ONLY when ufo switch (K8) is ON (switch open)
- Bootloader
- low throttle limit to prevent motor shutoffs while in flight
- spectrum DX transmitters are now supported.
  set the synchronisation gap to 5 ms or more.
- NEW: Holgers brushless ESCs are now supported and tested!

19.4.2007 V3.11 released by Wolferl
- Bugfix: spurios beeps in flight fixed
- NEW: Holgers brushless ESCs are now supported and tested!

13.5.2007 V3.12 released by Wolferl
- Low voltage detection on the 3.1 PCB can ONLY be positive
- Version split vor ADXRS150 and ADXRS300 gyros
- Bugfix: only 3.1 PCB: beeper did not stop beeping when
  turning off the ufo switch
- Blue LED now flashes when doing M commands (setting params)
- Red LED now flashes if batt voltage is low,
  nice for those ufos with no beeper connected.
- Diff-factors on Roll and Nick are now pure differential factors!
  New P-factor = Old P-factor + old D-factor!
- compass sensor supported (on black PCB only)
