= VERSION HISTORY                            =
==============================================

In general, the 3.0x version and the 3.1x versions come
from the same source repository, so both versions
have basically the same features.
Since the newer black PCB has a slightly different 
circuit, there may be some features only available in
the V3.1x versions.

Note:
-----
V3.0x is ONLY for the "green PCB"
V3.1x is ONLY for the now sold "black PCB"


15.3.2007 V3.05/V3.10 released by Wolferl
First public released version.
- Reworked RX stick reading (does no longer influence PID controllers)
- Camera servos working. Use RX channel 6 für elevation control.
- "Model lost" beeper works now ONLY when ufo switch (K8) is ON (switch open)
- Bootloader
- low throttle limit to prevent motor shutoffs while in flight
- spectrum DX transmitters are now supported.
  set the synchronisation gap to 5 ms or more.
- NEW: Holgers brushless ESCs are now supported and tested!

19.4.2007 V3.06/V3.11 released by Wolferl
- Bugfix: spurios beeps in flight fixed
- NEW: Holgers brushless ESCs are now supported and tested!

13.5.2007 V3.12 released by Wolferl
- Low voltage detection on the 3.1 PCB can ONLY be positive
- Version split vor ADXRS150 and ADXRS300 gyros
- Bugfix: only 3.1 PCB: beeper did not stop beeping when
  turning off the ufo switch
- Blue LED now flashes when doing M commands (setting params)
- Red LED now flashes if batt voltage is low,
  nice for those ufos with no beeper connected.
- Diff-factors on Roll and Nick are now pure differential factors!
  New P-factor = Old P-factor + old D-factor!
- compass sensor supported (on black PCB only)

04.07.2007 V3.07/V3.13 released by Wolferl
- 3.1 PCB and IDG300: Roll and Nick gyro is now measured with
  3.6 volts reference. When upgrading from a previous version,
  divide roll and nick proportional factors by 1.3
- Compass sensor HMC6352 fully supported
- flip problem fixed (limiting both motors now)
- smoothing of roll and nick stick signals implemented
- camera servos now selectable 0 or 45 degrees
- Throttlecurve available (extra HEX file)
- Dynamic Stability Program, good for overpowered ufos :-)

= Transferring firmware to the PIC           =
==============================================

If you already have a PIC with at least software version 3.05,
You can upload your new version using the bootloader.
Use UAVPset.exe to do that.

But be careful: If you mock up things completely, you can lock
yourself out. Then you would need a PIC programmer to get things
working again.

==============================================
= SAFETY FIRST!                              =
==============================================

If you work on your ufo model, PLEASE TAKE CARE!

Nowadays, extremely powerful motors and accumulators
can pose a serious threat to your safety.

Safety measures:
- Remove the propellers before you test parameter or firmware modifications
- Work with a good bench power supply instead of an accupack.
  A short circuit will then not be able to destroy your hardware too easily
- Your ufo mainboards electronics can be damaged by 
  electrostatic discharge sparks. Make sure you are doing any
  work at the electronics in an ESD safe workplace.
- When using your transmitter, be sure to use the correct model memory on it.
- Be sure to have no other transmitters on your channel on air.

The author will NOT BE RESPONSABLE FOR ANY ACCIDENTS OR
INJURIES IN ANY WAY!

PLEASE do yourself a favour and get an insurance which covers risks by doing model flight!
Imaging what happens if you only damage someone elses car or something....

If you have any questions, please go to the forum at 
http://forum.uavp.ch
and feel free to ask. There are a lot of people that will happily help you,
including the author (his nickname is "Wolferl").

However, a registration is required to gain access to the forum.

Alternatively, you can contact the author by e-mail at
wolfgang@opensourcequadrocopter.de

BUT PLEASE, BEFORE YOU ASK, READ THE MANUAL.
It is all in there, really!

Also, if you have some hardware related questions, please download the 
datasheets for the chips and read them thoroughly!

Make sure you have the most recent version of the firmware!
